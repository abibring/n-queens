# n-queens
This is the classic n-queens problem.  The idea is to determine how many queens you can fit on an NxN chessboard, so that no two queens can attack each other.  You can also calculate the number of rooks you could fit on an NxN chessboard. Enjoy!

## To Run Locally:
Clone the repo.  

Open BoardViewer.html in your browser to see a visual representation of a chessboard and be able to place pieces on the board.  When your queens are attacking each other on the board, it will turn red. 

To view the specs tests, open SpecRunner.html in your browser.  Each test will have a green or red check next to it, indicating whether or not the test has passed.
